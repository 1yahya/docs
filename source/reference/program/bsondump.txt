Synopsis
--------

The :binary:`~bin.bsondump` converts :term:`BSON` files into human-readable
formats, including :term:`JSON`. For example, :binary:`~bin.bsondump` is useful
for reading the output files generated by :binary:`~bin.mongodump`.

.. important:: :binary:`~bin.bsondump` is a diagnostic tool for inspecting
   BSON files, not a tool for data ingestion or other application use.

Options
-------

.. binary:: bsondump

.. program:: bsondump

.. option:: --help

   Returns information on the options and use of :program:`bsondump`.


.. option:: --verbose, -v

   Increases the amount of internal reporting returned on standard output
   or in log files. Increase the verbosity with the ``-v`` form by
   including the option multiple times, (e.g. ``-vvvvv``.)
   


.. option:: --quiet

   Runs the :program:`bsondump` in a quiet mode that attempts to limit the amount
   of output.

   This option suppresses:
   
   - output from :term:`database commands <database command>`
   
   - replication activity
   
   - connection accepted events
   
   - connection closed events
   


.. option:: --version

   Returns the :program:`bsondump` release number.


.. option:: --objcheck

   Validates each :term:`BSON` object before outputting it in :term:`JSON`
   format. By default, :program:`bsondump` enables :option:`--objcheck`.
   For objects with a high degree of sub-document nesting,
   :option:`--objcheck` can have a small impact on performance. You can set
   :option:`--noobjcheck` to disable object checking.
   
   .. versionchanged:: 2.4
      MongoDB enables :option:`--objcheck` by default, to prevent any
      client from inserting malformed or invalid BSON into a MongoDB
      database.


.. option:: --noobjcheck

   .. versionadded:: 2.4
   
   Disables the default document validation that MongoDB performs on all
   incoming BSON documents.
   


.. option:: --filter <JSON>

   Limits the documents that :program:`bsondump` exports to only those
   documents that match the :term:`JSON document` specified as
   ``'<JSON>'``. Be sure to include the document in single quotes to avoid
   interaction with your system's shell environment.


.. option:: --type <=json|=debug>

   Changes the operation of :program:`bsondump` from outputting
   ":term:`JSON`" (the default) to a debugging format.


.. option:: <bsonFilename>

   The final argument to :program:`bsondump` is a document containing
   :term:`BSON`. This data is typically generated by
   :program:`bsondump` or by MongoDB in a :term:`rollback` operation.


Use
---

By default, :binary:`~bin.bsondump` outputs data to standard output. To
create corresponding :term:`JSON` files, you will need to use the
shell redirect. See the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   bsondump collection.bson > collection.json

Use the following command (at the system shell) to produce debugging
output for a :term:`BSON` file:

.. code-block:: sh

   bsondump --type=debug collection.bson
