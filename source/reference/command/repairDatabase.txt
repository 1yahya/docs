Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: repairDatabase

   Checks and repairs errors and inconsistencies in data storage.
   :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` is analogous to a ``fsck`` command for
   file systems. Run the :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` command to ensure
   data integrity after the system experiences an unexpected system
   restart or crash, if:

   #. The :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance is not running with
      :term:`journaling <journal>` enabled.

      .. include:: /includes/note-repair.rst

   #. There are *no* other intact :term:`replica set` members with a complete
      data set.

      .. include:: /includes/warning-repair.rst

   :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` takes the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { repairDatabase: 1 }

   :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` has the following fields:


   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 20 80
   
      * - Field
   
        - Type
   
        - Description
   
      * - ``preserveClonedFilesOnFailure``
   
        - boolean
   
        - When ``true``, ``repairDatabase`` will not delete temporary files
          in the backup directory on error, and all new files are created
          with the "backup" instead of "_tmp" directory prefix. By default
          ``repairDatabase`` does not delete temporary files, and uses the
          "_tmp" naming prefix for new files.
          
          
   
      * - ``backupOriginalFiles``
   
        - boolean
   
        - When ``true``, ``repairDatabase`` moves old database files to the
          backup directory instead of deleting them before moving new files
          into place. New files are created with the "backup" instead of "_tmp"
          directory prefix. By default, ``repairDatabase`` leaves temporary
          files unchanged, and uses the "_tmp" naming prefix for new files.
          
          
   


   You can explicitly set the options as follows:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { repairDatabase: 1,
        preserveClonedFilesOnFailure: <boolean>,
        backupOriginalFiles: <boolean> }

   .. include:: /includes/warning-blocking-global.rst

   .. note:: :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` requires free disk space equal to the size
      of your current data set plus 2 gigabytes. If the volume that holds dbpath
      lacks sufficient space, you can mount a separate volume
      and use that for the repair. When mounting a separate volume for
      :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` you must run :dbcommand:`repairDatabase`
      from the command line and use the
      :option:`--repairpath <mongod --repairpath>`
      switch to specify the folder in which to store
      temporary repair files.

   See :option:`mongod --repair` and :option:`mongodump --repair` for
   information on these related options.

Behavior
--------

The :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` command compacts all collections in the
database. It is identical to running the :dbcommand:`compact` command on
each collection individually.

:dbcommand:`repairDatabase` reduces the total size of the data files on
disk. It also recreates all indexes in the database.

The time requirement for :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` depends on the size of the
data set.

You may invoke :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` from multiple contexts:

- Use the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to run the command, as above.

- Use the :method:`db.repairDatabase()` in the :binary:`~bin.mongo`
  shell.

- Run :binary:`~bin.mongod` directly from your system's shell. Make sure
  that :binary:`~bin.mongod` isn't already running, and that you invoke
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` as a user that has access to MongoDB's data files. Run
  as:

  .. code-block:: sh

     mongod --repair

  To add a repair path:

  .. code-block:: sh

     mongod --repair --repairpath /opt/vol2/data

  .. note::

     :option:`mongod --repair <mongod --repair>` will fail if your database
     is not a master or primary. In most cases, you should recover a
     corrupt secondary using the data from an existing intact node. To
     run repair on a secondary/slave restart the instance in standalone
     mode without the :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>` or
     :option:`--slave <mongod --slave>` options.

Example
-------

.. code-block:: javascript

   { repairDatabase: 1 }

Using ``repairDatabase`` to Reclaim Disk Space
----------------------------------------------

You should not use :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` for data recovery
unless you have no other option.

However, if you trust that there is no corruption and you have enough
free space, then :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` is the appropriate and
the only way to reclaim disk space.
