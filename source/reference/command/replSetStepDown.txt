Description
-----------

.. dbcommand:: replSetStepDown

   Forces the :term:`primary` of the replica set to become a
   :term:`secondary`. This initiates an :ref:`election for primary
   <replica-set-election-internals>`.

   :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` has the following prototype form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( { replSetStepDown: <seconds> , force: <true|false> } )


   :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` has the following fields:


   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 20 80
   
      * - Field
   
        - Type
   
        - Description
   
      * - ``replSetStepDown``
   
        - number
   
        - Optional. A number of seconds for the member to avoid election to primary. If you
          do not specify a value for ``<seconds>``, :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown`
          will attempt to avoid reelection to primary for 60 seconds.
          
          
   
      * - ``force``
   
        - Boolean
   
        - Optional. New in version 2.0: Forces the :term:`primary` to step down even if
          there are no secondary members within 10 seconds of the primary's
          latest optime.
          
          
   


   .. warning:: :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` forces all clients
      currently connected to the database to disconnect. This helps
      ensure that clients maintain an accurate view of the replica
      set.

   .. versionadded:: 2.0
      If there is no :term:`secondary` within 10 seconds of the
      primary, :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` will not succeed to
      prevent long running elections.

Example
-------

The following example specifies that the former primary avoids
reelection to primary for 120 seconds:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { replSetStepDown: 120 } )

.. slave-ok, admin-only
