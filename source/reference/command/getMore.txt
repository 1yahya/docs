.. dbcommand:: getMore

   .. versionadded:: 3.2

   Use in conjunction with commands that return a cursor, e.g.
   :dbcommand:`find` and :dbcommand:`aggregate`, to return subsequent
   batches of documents currently pointed to by the cursor.

   The :dbcommand:`getMore` command has the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
         "getMore": <long>,
         "collection": <string>,
         "batchSize": <int>,
         "maxTimeMS": <int>
      }

   The command accepts the following fields:


   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 20 80
   
      * - Field
   
        - Type
   
        - Description
   
      * - ``getMore``
   
        - long
   
        - The cursor id.
          
          
   
      * - ``collection``
   
        - string
   
        - The name of the collection over which the cursor is operating.
          
          
   
      * - ``batchSize``
   
        - positive integer
   
        - Optional. The number of documents to return in the batch.
          
          
   
      * - ``maxTimeMS``
   
        - non-negative integer
   
        - Optional. Specifies a time limit in milliseconds for processing
          operations on a cursor. If you do not specify a value for maxTimeMS,
          operations will not time out. A value of ``0`` explicitly
          specifies the default unbounded behavior.
          
          MongoDB terminates operations that exceed their allotted time limit
          using the same mechanism as :method:`db.killOp()`. MongoDB only
          terminates an operation at one of its designated :term:`interrupt 
          points <interrupt point>`.
          
          
   


   .. versionadded:: 3.6

   If :doc:`authentication </core/authentication>` is turned on, you can 
   only issue a :dbcommand:`getMore` against cursors you created.
