.. method:: rs.stepDown(seconds)

   Forces the current :term:`replica set` member to step down as
   :term:`primary` and then attempt to avoid election as primary for
   the designated number of seconds. Produces an error if the current
   member is not the primary.

   The :method:`rs.stepDown()` method has the following parameter:


   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 20 80
   
      * - Parameter
   
        - Type
   
        - Description
   
      * - ``seconds``
   
        - number
   
        - Optional. The duration of time that the stepped-down member attempts to avoid
          reelection as primary. If this parameter is not specified, the method
          uses the default value of 60 seconds.
          
          
   


   This function disconnects the shell briefly and forces a
   reconnection as the replica set renegotiates which member
   will be primary. As a result, the shell will display an
   error even if this command succeeds.

   :method:`rs.stepDown()` provides a wrapper around the
   :term:`database command` :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown`.
