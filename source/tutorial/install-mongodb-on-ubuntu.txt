For help with troubleshooting errors encountered while installing
MongoDB on Ubuntu, see our
:ref:`troubleshooting <install-ubuntu-troubleshooting>` guide.

Run MongoDB Community Edition
-----------------------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-installation-ulimit.rst

.. |mongod-user| replace:: ``mongodb``
.. |mongod-datadir| replace:: ``/var/lib/mongodb``

Directories
   If you installed via the package manager, the data directory
   |mongod-datadir| and the log directory ``/var/log/mongodb`` are
   created during the installation.

   By default, MongoDB runs using the |mongod-user| user account. If
   you change the user that runs the MongoDB process, you **must** also
   modify the permission to the data and log directories to give this
   user access to these directories.

Configuration File
   The official MongoDB package includes a 
   :ref:`configuration file <configuration-file>` 
   (:file:`/etc/mongod.conf`). These settings
   (such as the data directory and log directory specifications) take
   effect upon startup. That is, if you change the configuration file
   while the MongoDB instance is running, you must restart the instance
   for the changes to take effect.

.. important::

   The following instructions assume that you have downloaded the  
   official MongoDB ``mongodb-org`` packages, and not the unofficial  
   ``mongodb`` package provided by Ubuntu.
